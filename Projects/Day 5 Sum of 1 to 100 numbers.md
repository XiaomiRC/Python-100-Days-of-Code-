# Question
Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop

### Solution:
```python
total = 0  # Initialize total to 0

# Iterate through numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive)
for number in range(1, 101):
    total += number  # Add each number to total

# Print the sum of numbers from 1 to 100
print(f"The sum of 1 to 100 numbers is {total}")
```
