## Question:
What does the following Python code snippet do?

## Description:
The provided Python code snippet initializes a list named `dirty_dozen` with 12 items representing fruits and vegetables. It then performs two operations on this list and prints the list after each operation.

### Initialization and Appending:
- Initially, the list `dirty_dozen` is created with the following items: "Strawberries", "Spinach", "Kale", "Nectarines", "Apples", "Grapes", "Peaches", "Cherries", "Pears", "Tomatoes", "Celery", "Potatoes".
- After initializing the list, the code appends the string "Aspargus" to the end of the `dirty_dozen` list using the `append()` method.
- The first print statement outputs the contents of `dirty_dozen` after appending "Aspargus".

### Extending the List:
- Following the first operation, the code extends the `dirty_dozen` list with three additional items: "Beans", "Cauliflowers", and "Cabbage".
- The second print statement displays the contents of `dirty_dozen` after extending it with multiple items.


```python
# Initialize the list `dirty_dozen` with 12 items representing fruits and vegetables
dirty_dozen = ["Strawberries", "Spinach", "Kale", "Nectarines", "Apples", "Grapes", "Peaches", "Cherries", "Pears", "Tomatoes", "Celery", "Potatoes"]

# Append "Aspargus" to the end of the `dirty_dozen` list
dirty_dozen.append("Aspargus")
print(dirty_dozen)  # Print the contents of `dirty_dozen` after appending "Aspargus"

# Extend `dirty_dozen` with three additional items: "Beans", "Cauliflowers", "Cabbage"
dirty_dozen.extend(["Beans", "Cauliflowers", "Cabbage"])
print(dirty_dozen)  # Print the contents of `dirty_dozen` after extending with multiple items
```
### Output:
```
[ "Strawberries", "Spinach", "Kale", "Nectarines", "Apples", "Grapes", "Peaches", "Cherries", "Pears", "Tomatoes", "Celery", "Potatoes", "Aspargus" ]

[ "Strawberries", "Spinach", "Kale", "Nectarines", "Apples", "Grapes", "Peaches", "Cherries", "Pears", "Tomatoes", "Celery", "Potatoes", "Aspargus", "Beans", "Cauliflowers", "Cabbage" ]

```
