# Let's analyze the code snippet below:
```python
fruits = ["Apple","Peach","Pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")
    print(fruits)
print(fruits)
```
Here's what happens step by step inside the loop:

**Iteration 1 (`fruit = "Apple"`):**

- `print(fruit)` outputs: Apple
- `print(fruit + " Pie")` outputs: Apple Pie
- `print(fruits)` outputs: `["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]`

**Iteration 2 (`fruit = "Peach"`):**

- `print(fruit)` outputs: Peach
- `print(fruit + " Pie")` outputs: Peach Pie
- `print(fruits)` outputs: `["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]`

**Iteration 3 (`fruit = "Pear"`):**

- `print(fruit)` outputs: Pear
- `print(fruit + " Pie")` outputs: Pear Pie
- `print(fruits)` outputs: `["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]`

After the loop completes, it executes `print(fruits)` once more, which outputs: `["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]`.

### Final Output:
```css
Apple
Apple Pie
['Apple', 'Peach', 'Pear']
Peach
Peach Pie
['Apple', 'Peach', 'Pear']
Pear
Pear Pie
['Apple', 'Peach', 'Pear']
['Apple', 'Peach', 'Pear']
```
Each fruit in the list `fruits` is printed along with its corresponding "Pie" message, and then the entire list `fruits` is printed both inside and outside the loop.
