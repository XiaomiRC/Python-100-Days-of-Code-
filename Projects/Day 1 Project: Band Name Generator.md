# Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator
Create a program which takes the city which the user grew up in and their pet's name as an input and creates a band name by concatenating these two strings 

```
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")
city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("What's your pet's name?\n")
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
```
