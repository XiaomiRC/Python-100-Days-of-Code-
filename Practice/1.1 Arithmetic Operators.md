# Write a program to add 100 and 200
```python
num1 = 100
num2 = 200
total  = 100 + 200
print("The sum of 100 and 200 is: ", total)
```

# Write a program to add 2 numbers with user input

```python
total=0
print("This program give you the sum of numbers")
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
total = num1 + num2
print("The sum of the two numbers is: ", total)
```
# Write a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and then ask them to choose an operation from the following options:

- Press 1 to Add
- Press 2 to Subtract
- Press 3 to Multiply
- Press 4 to Divide

If the user selects addition, subtraction, or multiplication, the program should output the result with an appropriate message. If the user selects division, ensure to handle division by zero. If the user enters an invalid choice, display an error message.


```python
# Prompt the user to enter the first number and convert it to an integer
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number\n"))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number and convert it to an integer
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number\n"))

# Prompt the user to enter the operation choice and display options
user_choice = input("Enter the operation you want to perform\nPress 1 to Add\nPress 2 to Subtract\nPress 3 to Multiply\nPress 4 to Divide\n")

# Check the user's choice and perform the corresponding operation
if user_choice == '1':
    # If user chooses 1, compute and print the sum of num1 and num2
    print(f"The sum is: {num1 + num2}")
elif user_choice == '2':
    # If user chooses 2, compute and print the difference of num1 and num2
    print(f"The difference is: {num1 - num2}")
elif user_choice == '3':
    # If user chooses 3, compute and print the product of num1 and num2
    print(f"The product is: {num1 * num2}")
elif user_choice == '4':
    # If user chooses 4, check if num2 is zero before computing and printing the quotient of num1 and num2
    if num2 == 0:
        print("Error! Division by zero.")
    else:
        print(f"The quotient is: {num1 / num2}")
else:
    # If user inputs an invalid choice (not 1, 2, 3, or 4), print an error message
    print("Invalid choice")
```
