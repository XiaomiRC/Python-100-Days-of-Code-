# Write a Python program that generates the multiplication table for a number entered by the user. Print the multiplication table up to 10.

```python
# Display a welcome message to the user
print("Welcome to the multiplication table generator!")

# Prompt the user to enter a number for which multiplication table is to be generated
num = int(input("Enter the number for which you want to generate multiplication tables: "))

# Loop through numbers 1 to 10 to generate the multiplication table
for i in range(1, 10+1):
    # Print the multiplication table in the format: num x i = num * i
    print(num, "x", i, "=", num*i)
```
