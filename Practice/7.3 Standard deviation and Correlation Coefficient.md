### Standard deviation and Correlation
**Standard deviation** is a measure of how spread out the values in a data set are around the mean. It provides a way to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. 

**Example**
Imagine you have the following five test scores for a class: `70, 75, 80, 85, and 90`. Let's calculate the standard deviation step-by-step.

1. **Find the Mean:** Mean = (70+75+80+85+90) / 5 = 400 / 5 = 80 
2. **Calculate the Deviations:** Subtract the mean from each score:
-  70 ‚àí 80 = ‚àí10
-  75 ‚àí 80 = ‚àí5
-  80 ‚àí 80 = 0
-  85 ‚àí 80 = 5
-  90 ‚àí 80 = 10
3. **Square the Deviations:**
- (‚àí10) * (-10) = 100
- (-5) * (-5) = 25
- 0 * 0 = 0
- 5 * 5 = 25
- 10 * 10 = 100
4. **Find the Mean of Squared Deviations (Variance):** Add up the squared deviations and divide by the number of scores:

Variance = (100 + 25 + 0 + 25 + 100)/ 5 = 250 / 5 = 50 

5. **Take the Square Root to Find the Standard Deviation:**

Standard¬†Deviation = Sq root 50 ‚âà7.07

So, the standard deviation of these test scores is approximately 7.07. This means that, on average, each score deviates from the mean by about 7.07 points.

**Correlation** is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables are related. It indicates how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

**Types of Correlation:**

1. **Positive Correlation:** When one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well. For example, height and weight often have a positive correlation; as height increases, weight often increases.
2. **Negative Correlation:** When one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. For example, the number of hours spent watching TV might have a negative correlation with academic performance; as TV time increases, academic performance might decrease.
3. **No Correlation:** When changes in one variable have no predictable relationship with changes in another variable. For example, there might be no correlation between the number of books a person reads and their shoe size.

**Correlation Coefficient:** The strength and direction of a correlation are measured by the correlation coefficient, which ranges from `-1 to 1`:
- **1:** Perfect positive correlation. As one variable increases, the other increases perfectly in sync.
- **-1:** Perfect negative correlation. As one variable increases, the other decreases perfectly in sync.
- **0:** No correlation. There is no predictable relationship between the variables

The most commonly used correlation coefficient is Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient, denoted as `ùëü`. It measures the linear relationship between two variables.

**Interpreting Correlation Coefficients:**
- **0 < r < 0.3:** Weak positive correlation
- **0.3 ‚â§ r < 0.7:** Moderate positive correlation
- **0.7 ‚â§ r < 1:** Strong positive correlation
- **‚àí0.3 < r < 0:** Weak negative correlation
- **‚àí0.7 ‚â§ r ‚â§ ‚àí0.3:** Moderate negative correlation
- **‚àí1 ‚â§ r ‚â§ ‚àí0.7:** Strong negative correlation
