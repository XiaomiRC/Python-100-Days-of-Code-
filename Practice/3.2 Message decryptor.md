# Question:
Write a Python program that decrypts a message encrypted using a Caesar cipher technique. The program should prompt the user to enter an encrypted message and specify the number of characters by which each letter was shifted during encryption. Implement the decryption process and display the original message.

### Instructions for the Task:
- Begin by printing a welcome message to the user indicating it's a Message Decryptor.
- Prompt the user to input an encrypted message.
- Request the number of characters by which each letter was shifted during encryption.
- Decrypt the message using the specified shift value and display the original message.
### Expected Output:
For example, if the user enters "khoor" as the encrypted message and specifies a shift of 3 characters, the program should output "hello".


```python
print("Welcome to the Message Decryptor")
word = input("Enter a message : " ).lower()

output = ''
shift= int(input("Enter how many characters you wish to shift : "))

for i in word:
  new_ascii = ord(i) - shift
  
  if new_ascii < 97:
    new_ascii = new_ascii + 26
  
  output += chr(new_ascii)

print(output, end="")
```
