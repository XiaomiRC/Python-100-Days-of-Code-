### 1. Creating Numpy array
#### Problem 1:
```python
# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))
```
#### Problem 2:
- Create a numpy array from `height_in`. Name this new array `np_height_in`.
- Print `np_height_in`.
- Multiply `np_height_in` with `0.0254` to convert all height measurements from inches to meters. Store the new values in a new array, `np_height_m`.
- Print out `np_height_m` and check if the output makes sense
```python
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out np_height_in
print(np_height_in)

# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height_in * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)
```
### NumPy Side Effects
numpy is great for doing vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.

First of all, numpy arrays cannot contain elements with different types. Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as +, -, * and / have a different meaning for regular Python lists and numpy arrays.
#### Example:
```python
np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])
```
This will be calculated as:
`np.array([4, 3, 0]) + np.array([0, 2, 2])`

So, the Output would be 
`array([4, 5, 2])`

### Subsetting NumPy Arrays
Subsetting (using the square bracket notation on lists or arrays) works exactly the same with both lists and arrays.

This exercise already has two lists, `height_in` and `weight_lb`, loaded in the background for you. These contain the height and weight of the MLB players as regular lists. It also has two numpy array lists, `np_weight_lb` and `np_height_in` prepared for you.

- Subset `np_weight_lb` by printing out the element at index 50.
- Print out a sub-array of `np_height_in` that contains the elements at index 100 up to and including index 110.

```python
import numpy as np

# Convert the lists 'weight_lb' and 'height_in' into numpy arrays
np_weight_lb = np.array(weight_lb)
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print the weight value at index 50 of the numpy array 'np_weight_lb'
print(np_weight_lb[50])

# Print a sub-array from 'np_height_in' that includes elements from index 100 up to and including index 110
# Note: Slicing in numpy arrays is inclusive of the start index and exclusive of the end index, so use 111 to include index 110
print(np_height_in[100:111])
```
### 2D NumPy Array

- Use `np.array()` to create a 2D numpy array from `baseball`. Name it `np_baseball`.
- Print out the type of `np_baseball`.
- Print out the shape attribute of `np_baseball`. Use `np_baseball.shape`.
```python
import numpy as np

baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)
```
#### Output:
```
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
(4, 2)
```
### Subsetting 2D NumPy Arrays
The indexes before the comma refer to the rows, while those after the comma refer to the columns. The `:` is for slicing.
- Print out the 50th row of `np_baseball`.
- Make a new variable, `np_weight_lb`, containing the entire second column of `np_baseball`.
- Select the height (first column) of the 124th baseball player in `np_baseball` and print it out.
```python
import numpy as np

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49,:])

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb
np_weight_lb = np_baseball[:,1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123,:])
```
### 2D Arithmetic
2D `numpy` arrays can perform calculations element by element, like `numpy` arrays.

`np_baseball` is coded for you; it's again a 2D numpy array with 3 columns representing height (in inches), weight (in pounds) and age (in years). `baseball` is available as a regular list of lists and `updated` is available as 2D numpy array.
- You managed to get hold of the changes in height, weight and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D numpy array, `updated`. Add `np_baseball` and `updated` and print out the `result`.
- You want to convert the units of height and weight to metric (meters and kilograms, respectively). As a first step, create a numpy array with three values: `0.0254`, `0.453592` and `1`. Name this array `conversion`.
- Multiply `np_baseball` with `conversion` and print out the result.
```python
import numpy as np

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated
result = np_baseball + updated
print(result)
# Create numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254,0.453592,1])

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(np_baseball * conversion)
```
