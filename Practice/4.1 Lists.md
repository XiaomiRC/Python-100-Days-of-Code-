# Copying Lists
**[Note]** If you want to prevent changes in `areas_copy` from also taking effect in `areas`, you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the `areas` list with `list()` or by using `[:]`.
```python
# Define a list containing the areas of different rooms
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Create a copy of the areas list to work with separately
areas_copy = areas[:]

# Modify the first element of the copied list to a new value
areas_copy[0] = 5.0

# Output the original areas list to show it has not been altered
print(areas)

# Output the modified copy of the areas list to show the changes
print(areas_copy)
```
