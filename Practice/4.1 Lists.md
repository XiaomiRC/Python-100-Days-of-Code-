# Copying Lists
**[Note]** If you want to prevent changes in `areas_copy` from also taking effect in `areas`, you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the `areas` list with `list()` or by using `[:]`.
```python
# Define a list containing the areas of different rooms
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Create a copy of the areas list to work with separately
areas_copy = areas[:]

# Modify the first element of the copied list to a new value
areas_copy[0] = 5.0

# Output the original areas list to show it has not been altered
print(areas)

# Output the modified copy of the areas list to show the changes
print(areas_copy)
```
### Using `.index()`
```python
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))

# Print out how often 9.50 appears in areas
print(areas.count(9.50))
```
### Using `.append()`, `.reverse`
```python
# Initialize a list with various area measurements
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Add two more area measurements to the list: poolhouse and garage sizes
areas.append(24.5)   # Adding the poolhouse size
areas.append(15.45)  # Adding the garage size

# Output the updated list of areas
print(areas)

# Reverse the order of elements in the 'areas' list in-place
areas.reverse()

# Output the list with elements in reversed order
print(areas)
```
