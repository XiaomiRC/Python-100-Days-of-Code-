### Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer entered by the user. Ensure the program handles negative inputs gracefully by displaying a message indicating that factorial is not defined for negative numbers. Additionally, ensure the program correctly calculates the factorial of `0`as `1`.

### Solution:

```python
# Display a welcome message to the user
print("Welcome to the Factorial Calculator!")

# Prompt the user to enter a number for which factorial is to be calculated
num = int(input("Enter the number for which you want to calculate factorial:\n"))

if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
elif num == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    # Initialize factorial to 1 (since factorial of 0 is 1)
    factorial = 1

    # Calculate factorial using a loop
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        factorial = i * factorial

    # Print the calculated factorial
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is : {factorial}")

```
