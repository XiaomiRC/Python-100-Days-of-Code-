### Using `len()` function & converting boolean into integer

```python
# Initialize a list with elements 1, 2, 3, and 4
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Initialize a boolean variable set to True
var2 = True

# Print the type of var1 to confirm it's a list
print(type(var1))

# Print the number of elements in var1
print(len(var1))

# Convert the boolean variable var2 to an integer (True becomes 1, False becomes 0)
out2 = int(var2)
```
### `help()` function
To get help on the max() function, for example, you can use one of these calls:
```
help(max)
?max
```
### Using `sorted()` to sort list contents in descending order
```python
# Define the first list of area measurements
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]

# Define the second list of area measurements
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Concatenate the two lists into a single list named 'full'
full = first + second

# Sort the 'full' list in descending order and store the result in 'full_sorted'
full_sorted = sorted(full, reverse=True)

# Output the sorted list to display the areas in descending order
print(full_sorted)
```
### Using `.upper()` and `.count()`
```python
# Define a string variable with the value "poolhouse"
place = "poolhouse"

# Convert the string in 'place' to uppercase and store it in 'place_up'
place_up = place.upper()

# Output the original string and its uppercase version
print(place)
print(place_up)

# Count and print the number of occurrences of the letter 'o' in the original string
print(place.count('o'))
```
