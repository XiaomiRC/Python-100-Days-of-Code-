### WAP to divide 2 numbers and print the:
 - i) result as float
 - ii) result as integer
 - iii) result rounded off to the nearest number. ie if the value is 0.5, it should print 1 and if the value is 0.4, it should print 0.
 - iv) result rounded off to 2 decimal places
 - v) print the quotient
 - vi) print the remainder


```python
print("This is a program to divide a number")
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number\n"))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number\n"))
result_as_float = num1 / num2
result_as_int = int(num1/num2)
result_rounded_off = round(num1/num2)
result_rounded_off_2_places = round(num1/num2,2)
qoutient = num1//num2
remainder = num1%num2
print(f"The result of the division as float is {result_as_float}")
print(f"The result of the division as int is {result_as_int}")
print(f"The result of the division rounded off to the nearest number is {result_rounded_off}")
print(f"The result of the division rounded off to 2 decimal places is {result_rounded_off_2_places}")
print("The qoutient is",qoutient)
print("The remainder is",remainder)
```
