### Write a Python program that calculates and displays the volume, lateral surface area, and total surface area of a cylinder based on the radius (𝑟) and height (ℎ) entered by the user. Ensure the program handles cases where the radius is not a positive number by providing appropriate feedback to the user.

### Formulas
- The volume of a cylinder = Area of the base × Height of the cylinder = πr²h
- Lateral Surface Area = Perimeter of base × height = 2πrh = πdh
- Total Surface Area = Lateral Surface Area + Area of bases = 2πrh + 2πr² = 2πr (h+r)

### Solution:
``` python
# Display a welcome message to the user
print("Welcome to the Cylinder Dimension Calculator!")

# Prompt the user to enter the radius of the cylinder
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the cylinder:\n"))

# Prompt the user to enter the height of the cylinder
height = float(input("Enter the height of the cylinder:\n"))

# Define the value of pi
pi = 3.14159265359

# Check if the radius is greater than 0
if radius > 0:
    # Calculate and round the volume of the cylinder
    volume = round(pi * radius ** 2 * height, 2)
    
    # Calculate and round the lateral surface area of the cylinder
    lateral_surface_area = round(2 * pi * radius * height, 2)
    
    # Calculate and round the total surface area of the cylinder
    total_surface_area = round(2 * pi * radius * (height + radius), 2)
    
    # Print the calculated dimensions of the cylinder
    print("Volume:", volume)
    print("Lateral Surface Area:", lateral_surface_area)
    print("Total Surface Area:", total_surface_area)
else:
    # Inform the user if the input radius is not valid
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a positive number for the radius.")
```
